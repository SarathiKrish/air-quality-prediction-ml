# Predicting Air Quality Levels Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms for Environmental Insights

This project is part of the **Naan Mudhalvan** initiative, developed by Sarathi.K, Sathish.S, Karthick.P, and Sibiraj.N from A.K.T Memorial College of Engineering and Technology, B.E. CSE.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This machine learning-based project aims to predict air quality levels using environmental pollution indicators such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and others. The predictions are made using a trained model and visualized through a user-friendly Streamlit web app.
